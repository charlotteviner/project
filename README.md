## Core Skills: Individual Project

The intention of the software is to build a program that models rainfall in a landscape. The model is designed to randomly create raindrops in the landscape, make them move downslope, and trace the paths of the raindrops to allow visualisation of the drainage network in the environment. The program also provides the user with the option to calculate the total volume of water that reaches an outlet point in the landscape.
